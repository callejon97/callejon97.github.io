Aerospace Engineering MSc from Delft University of Technology (TUDelft),
and BSc at Technical University of Madrid (UPM). Very interested in
space from both a scientific and technologic point of view, currently
working in the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) domain. Robust
mathematical abstraction capabilities and deep understanding of
metaheuristic, numerical optimisation, and astrodynamic algorithms
proven by previous experience. Strong team-working, assertivity,
communication, and drive skills proven by international working
environment. Looking for upcoming challenges which can broaden my
knowledge and working experience.

Technical Experience
====================

ALGORITHMS ENGINEER IN THE SPACE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS (SSA) TEAM Apr. 2023 --- Currently
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*GMV Tres Cantos, Comunidad de Madrid, Spain*

-   Development of astrodynamics GMV C++ library for building and
    maintaining a space catalogue of objects.

    -   Low-level implementation of features in the library, and
        extensive validation through testing.

    -   High-level analysis of the functionality and limitations of the
        algorithmic.

    -   International working environment with team members working from
        Germany, France, and Spain .

INTERN IN THE SPACE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS (SSA) TEAM Jun. 2022 --- Apr. 2023
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*GMV Tres Cantos, Comunidad de Madrid, Spain*

-   Performing Master's thesis: [Assimilation of Swarm C atmospheric
    density observations into
    NRLMSISE-00](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:f472201e-0e32-4b9e-8aa3-04521908396a).

    -   Literature study on atmospheric density models, and data
        assimilation approaches.

    -   Created a data assimilation approach to improve the accuracy of
        density models with several space weather conditions, satellite
        geometries, and altitudes, and implemented it in a GMV C++
        library.

    -   Preliminary results presented in [NEO-SST 2
        conference](https://conference.sdo.esoc.esa.int/proceedings/neosst2/paper/90/NEOSST2-paper90.pdf).

INTERN IN THE ADVANCED CONCEPTS TEAM (ACT) Jul. 2020 --- Nov. 2020
------------------------------------------------------------------

*European Space Agency (ESA) Noordwijk, Zuid Holland, The Netherlands*

-   Main task: create and develop optimisation challenges in the web
    platform [optimize](https://optimize.esa.int/).

-   Three challenges created: Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission
    design, Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) based on space debris
    recovery, and interferometry reconstruction.
